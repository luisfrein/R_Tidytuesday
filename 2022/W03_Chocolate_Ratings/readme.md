![Dumbbell plot that shows countries on the y axis and number of chocolate bars on the x axis. There are 2 dots for each country, one that shows the number of chocolates made in house with the country's own cocoa beans and one that shows the total amount of chocolate bars made with the country's cocoa beans. For countries like Venezuela their cocoa beans are used to make more than 200 chocolate bars, but only 31 of those are made in house.](https://github.com/luisfrein/R_Tidytuesday/blob/master/2022/W03_Chocolate_Ratings/W03_Chocolate_Ratings.png)
